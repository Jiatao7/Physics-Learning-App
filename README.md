# Physics Learning App

### Overview
This was my culminating project for my grade 12 computer science course.

It is an user-friendly GUI application developed with Java Swing, designed to teach users about the concept of friction.

### Key Features:
* **Interactive Simulation:** Allows users to control variables such as the coefficient of friction and mass to observe their effects on an object's motion
* **Practice Problems:** Randomly assigns friction problems and offers users the ability to check their answers, view a hint, or access the full solution
* **Quiz:** Generates a set of problems for users to solve and tracks their scores to assess their understanding

### Try Out the Project:
*To try out the project, make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.*

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Jiatao7/Physics-Learning-App.git
cd Physics-Learning-App
```

Compile the code:
```
javac -encoding UTF-8 -d bin src/*.java
```

Run the code:
```
java -cp bin Main
```
