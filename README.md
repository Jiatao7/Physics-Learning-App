# Physics Learning App

A user-friendly GUI application developed with Java Swing, designed to teach users about the concept of friction.

Key Features:
-
* **Interactive Simulation:** Allows users to control variables such as the coefficient of friction and mass to observe their effects on an object's motion
* **Practice Problems:** Randomly assigns friction problems and offers users the ability to check their answers, view a hint, or access the full solution
* **Quiz:** Generates a set of problems for users to solve and tracks their scores to assess their understanding
