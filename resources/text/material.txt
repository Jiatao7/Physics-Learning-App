Force exerted by a surface on a stationary object
Increases as applied force increases
Acts in the opposite direction as attempted motion  
Object experiences no motion (as static friction force equals applied force so they cancel each other out)  
Occurs when the applied force is less than or equal to the starting friction  
Depends on 2 factors: coefficient of friction and normal force  
Force exerted by a surface on a moving object  
Constant (as long as surfaces don't change), regardless of applied force  
Acts in the opposite direction of the motion  
Occurs when the applied force is greater than the starting friction / maximum static friction  
Depends on 2 factors: coefficient of friction and normal force  
Experientially determined constant  
Depends on the nature of the two contacting surfaces  
Affects the amount of friction an object experiences  
Two types: coefficient of static friction and coefficient of kinetic friction 
Equation: frictional force = coefficient of friction x normal force
